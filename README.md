# Vaccine Safety Database

## Introduction
The Vaccine Safety Database is an open-source initiative dedicated to fostering transparency and collaboration in vaccine research. By providing a structured and publicly accessible repository of vaccine ingredients, types, and formulations, we aim to empower families, researchers, and advocates with trusted data for informed decision-making.

## Goals
- **Transparency**: Maintain a clear chain of evidence for all vaccine-related data, including a transparent history of changes and updates.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage contributions from the community to ensure data accuracy and comprehensiveness.
- **Empowerment**: Provide tools and insights to support vaccine safety research and decision-making.

One key to open-source work is change tracking. Unlike research journals, which often have a hard-to-navigate trail of evidence, each statement or data point in this repository has a transparent chain of change, going back to its original creation or 'commit.' This approach ensures accountability and clarity for all contributions.

## Data Sources
All data is derived from verified, publicly available sources, including:
- FDA regulatory documentation
- Peer-reviewed studies
- Manufacturer disclosures

## How to Use
1. **Explore the Data**: Review YAML files in the `data/` directory for structured information on ingredients, vaccines, and types.
2. **Integrate with Tools**: Use the data in your own projects or analyses.
3. **Collaborate**: Contribute new insights or correct inaccuracies (see below).
