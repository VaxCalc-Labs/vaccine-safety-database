# Vaccine Safety Database

## 🧠 Know What's In the Shot — From a Source You Can Trust

Welcome to the **VaxCalc Vaccine Safety Database**, an open-source project providing structured, transparent data on vaccine ingredients, types, and formulations — in plain, human-readable YAML.

This is *not* just another dataset. It's part of a broader mission to give parents, researchers, and health advocates the tools and backup they need to make informed, courageous decisions.
